    <h1>Why I Love Video Games</h1>
    <small>üìÖ 09-25-2025 | üè∑Ô∏è Random Thoughts</small>

    <p>
      The earliest memory I have of playing video games is on my brother‚Äôs original Xbox. I can‚Äôt even recall the game, but I do remember hanging out with him that day‚Äîand that was my first introduction to the gaming world..
    </p>
    <p>
      My more vivid memories came later, when Call of Duty became my second home (I know, sad). But honestly, where I grew up there were a lot of gangs‚Äîand there still are‚Äîso in a weird way, video games kept me safe. They gave me a reason to stay inside, hop on with my friends, and avoid a lot of the stuff that was happening outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, I wasn‚Äôt just a full-time homebody. I still joined after-school programs, played varsity soccer and volleyball in high school, and even ran with the running club back in middle school. But when the day wound down, you could bet I was in a CoD lobby or a FIFA (now EA FC) LAN tournament. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing beat the chaos of screaming at each other in game lobbies before a match (if you know, you know). The trash talk was ruthless, and the celebrations after a last-minute FIFA goal were pure comedy. It was loud, chaotic, and honestly, some of the best memories I have with friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, video games became a way to decompress and socialize‚Äîwithout the pressure of ‚Äúreal world‚Äù expectations. It was hanging out, but from the comfort of home (or surrounded by snacks and broken controllers).
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back, gaming has been there through every stage of my life. From middle school CoD lobbies to late-night FIFA rivalries, it‚Äôs more than just a hobby‚Äîit‚Äôs a shared experience, a way to bond, and one of my favorite escapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the day, that‚Äôs why I love video games. They‚Äôre fun, frustrating, sometimes ridiculous‚Äîbut they‚Äôve given me memories, friendships, and moments I wouldn‚Äôt trade for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I‚Äôll end this with a question: What‚Äôs your earliest gaming memory?
