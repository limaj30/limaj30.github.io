  <h1>Why I Love Video Games</h1>
  <p><em>09-25-2025 | Random Thoughts</em></p>

  <p>The earliest memory I have of playing video games is on my brother’s original Xbox. I can’t even recall the game, but I do remember hanging out with him that day—and that was my first introduction to the gaming world.</p>

  <p>My more vivid memories came later, when Call of Duty became my second home (I know, sad). But honestly, where I grew up there were a lot of gangs—and there still are—so in a weird way, video games kept me safe. They gave me a reason to stay inside, hop on with my friends, and avoid a lot of the stuff that was happening outside.</p>

  <p>Don’t get me wrong though, I wasn’t just a full-time homebody. I still joined after-school programs, played varsity soccer and volleyball in high school, and even ran with the running club back in middle school. But when the day wound down, you could bet I was in a CoD lobby or a FIFA (now EA FC) LAN tournament.</p>

  <p>Nothing beat the chaos of screaming at each other in game lobbies before a match (if you know, you know). The trash talk was ruthless, and the celebrations after a last-minute FIFA goal were pure comedy. It was loud, chaotic, and honestly, some of the best memories I have with friends.</p>

  <p>For me, video games became a way to decompress and socialize—without the pressure of “real world” expectations. It was hanging out, but from the comfort of home (or surrounded by snacks and broken controllers).</p>

  <p>Looking back, gaming has been there through every stage of my life. From middle school CoD lobbies to late-night FIFA rivalries, it’s more than just a hobby—it’s a shared experience, a way to bond, and one of my favorite escapes.</p>

  <p>At the end of the day, that’s why I love video games. They’re fun, frustrating, sometimes ridiculous—but they’ve given me memories, friendships, and moments I wouldn’t trade for anything.</p>

  <p><strong>So I’ll end this with a question: What’s your earliest gaming memory?</strong></p>
