  <h1>SSD vs HDD ‚Äî Which Should You Choose?</h1>
  <p><small>üìÖ 2025-09-22 | Category: <a href="tech.html">Tech</a></small></p>

  <p>When buying or building a computer, storage is one of the most important choices you‚Äôll make.  
  Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) have been around for decades, but Solid State Drives (SSDs) have changed the game when it comes to speed and performance.</p>

  <h2>Speed</h2>
  <p>SSDs are much faster than HDDs. With an SSD, your computer can boot in seconds instead of minutes, and programs load almost instantly.  
  HDDs, while still usable, feel sluggish by comparison‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre multitasking.</p>

  <h2>Capacity</h2>
  <p>HDDs win when it comes to storage size per dollar. You can get multiple terabytes of space at a much lower price than SSDs.  
  This makes HDDs useful for storing large files like videos, photos, or backups.</p>

  <h2>Reliability</h2>
  <p>Because SSDs have no moving parts, they‚Äôre generally more reliable and less prone to physical damage.  
  HDDs, with spinning disks and mechanical arms, are more likely to fail if dropped or heavily used.</p>

  <h2>Verdict</h2>
  <p>If you want speed and better performance, go with an SSD for your main drive.  
  If you need lots of cheap storage, an HDD is still useful as a secondary drive.  
  For many people, the best solution is a combination: an SSD for your operating system and programs, plus an HDD for bulk storage.</p>
