  <h1>Things I Wish I Knew Before Building a Gaming PC</h1>
  <p><small>üìÖ 2025-09-23 | Category: <a href="tech.html">Tech</a></small></p>

  <p>When I built my very first gaming PC, I wasn‚Äôt an IT technician.  
  I wasn‚Äôt even that tech-savvy‚Äîjust a kid who wanted to game without lag.  
  The process taught me a lot, but there are definitely things I wish I had known before starting.</p>

  <h2>1. Compatibility Matters More Than Looks</h2>
  <p>I spent way too much time picking RGB parts without realizing some of them wouldn‚Äôt even fit together.  
  Always check compatibility between your CPU, motherboard, and RAM first‚Äîfancy lights can come later.</p>

  <h2>2. Cable Management is Harder Than You Think</h2>
  <p>I thought cable management was just about making it look clean, but it also affects airflow.  
  Poor airflow = higher temps, which = worse performance.  
  Plan where your cables will go before you start plugging everything in.</p>

  <h2>3. Don‚Äôt Cheap Out on the Power Supply</h2>
  <p>The PSU isn‚Äôt the most exciting part, but it‚Äôs one of the most important.  
  A bad power supply can fry your components.  
  Spend a little more on a reliable brand and make sure it has enough wattage for your build.</p>

  <h2>4. Watch Tutorials‚ÄîBut Don‚Äôt Overthink It</h2>
  <p>YouTube tutorials saved me, but I also fell into the trap of over-researching.  
  At some point, you just have to start building.  
  It‚Äôs not as scary as it seems once you‚Äôve got all the parts laid out.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Building a PC taught me patience and problem-solving.  
  If you‚Äôre thinking about doing it‚Äîgo for it! Just make sure you plan your parts carefully, keep your cables tidy, and don‚Äôt underestimate the power supply.</p>
